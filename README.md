## Maya - The Voice Assistant

Maya is an advanced voice assistant powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (DL), Machine Learning (ML), Neural Networks (NN), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Designed to provide interactive and intelligent responses, Maya leverages state-of-the-art technologies to understand and act upon user commands.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes NLP techniques to accurately interpret and process user commands.
- **Deep Learning (DL) & Machine Learning (ML):** Employs deep learning and machine learning models to recognize intents and generate responses.
- **Neural Networks (NN):** Implements a neural network architecture to understand and categorize user input with high accuracy.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Integrates AI to handle a wide range of queries and perform complex tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maya-voice-assistant.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd maya-voice-assistant
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download or create the `intents.json` and `TrainData.pth` files and place them in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python maya.py
   ```

2. Speak your commands or queries to interact with Maya. The assistant will use its NLP and AI capabilities to process your input and provide relevant responses.

## Customization

- **Intents and Responses:** Update the `intents.json` file to add or modify intents and responses.
- **Model Training:** Retrain the neural network model with new data as needed. Ensure to update the `TrainData.pth` file with the latest trained model.
